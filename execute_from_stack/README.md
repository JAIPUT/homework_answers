# C: Execute CPU Instructions From the Stack

OP asserted C doesn't let you execute instructions from the stack.  This was
a textbook case of "Oh yeah?  Hold mah beer!"

Granted, the C language standard doesn't give you any tools for this, but C
language implementations quite often do.  In this case, I make use of POSIX,
and lean on the fact that most everyone running this code is using x86-64.

This needs tweaks to run on something other than Linux, but that should
surprise nobody.
