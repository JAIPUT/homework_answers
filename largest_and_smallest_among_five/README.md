# C++: Largest and Smallest Among Five

This one comes from here:

[How do you create a program that will determine the largest and smallest value among five numbers in C++ array using a while loop?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-create-a-program-that-will-determine-the-largest-and-smallest-value-among-five-numbers-in-C-array-using-a-while-loop)

My answer is straightforward:  Permute the array until it's sorted.  Then output
the first and last element. Simple, but _O(n!)._
