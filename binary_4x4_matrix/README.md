# C++: Generate Random 4×4 Binary Matrix and Find First Row and Column With the Most Ones

Uh... such an oddly specific request.  And, so I constructed an oddly specific
answer that makes use of a number of obscure techniques.

The SPOILERS version has better variable names and copious comments.  I suggest
resisting temptation to look at it until you're fully entranced by the version
I posted to Quora originally.

Bonus obfuscation: I spotted a typo when I wrote this, but I left it in,
because it doesn't actually change the meaning of the program.  But it does
add a "WTF?"  See if you can spot it without resorting to the SPOILERS.

Original: [How do you write a program that randomly fills in 0s and 1s into a 4-by-4 matrix, prints the matrix, and finds the first row and column with the most 1s?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-write-a-program-that-randomly-fills-in-0s-and-1s-into-a-4-by-4-matrix-prints-the-matrix-and-finds-the-first-row-and-column-with-the-most-1s/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
