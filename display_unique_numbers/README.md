# C++: Read Numbers and Display Only Unique Numbers

The original question wanted to stop at 10.  My answer will let you use as

Original: [How do I write a C++ program that reads in ten numbers and displays distinct numbers (i.e if a number appears multiple times, it is displayed only once).?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-write-a-C-program-that-reads-in-ten-numbers-and-displays-distinct-numbers-i-e-if-a-number-appears-multiple-times-it-is-displayed-only-once/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
