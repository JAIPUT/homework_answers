# C: Non-Trivial C Program Without any C Keywords

This isn't really a homework question, but still interesting enough to share.
There are two versions here.  The `initial` version represents what I initially
posted.  The `final` version goes much further, eliminating assignment, `++`,
`--`, and even _digits._

Both are also in the ultimate version of the answer, linked below.
