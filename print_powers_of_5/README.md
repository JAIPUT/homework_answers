# C: Generate the Series 1, 5, 25, 135, 625 With a While Loop

This homework assignment wants you to print out the first 5 powers of 5,
starting with 5^0 = 1.  I went a different direction, extracting them from
a carefully crafted string, bidirectionally.  :-D

In the comment section,
[Jack Brennen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Brennen) pointed out that
this approach doesn't scale.  I wrote an arbitrary precision version in
response.  That's the "scalable" version you see here.
