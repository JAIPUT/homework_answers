# C++: Display All Hour and Minute Values From 00:00 to 23:59

I decided to write this one flattening a two level loop next into a single
level.  It also has a minor bug that I left for OP to fix.

Original: [How can I write a program in C++ to display all the hour and minute values in a 24-hour clock from 00:00 to 23:59? Four digits must be displayed for each time.](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-write-a-program-in-C-to-display-all-the-hour-and-minute-values-in-a-24-hour-clock-from-00-00-to-23-59-Four-digits-must-be-displayed-for-each-time/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
