# C: Check Whether Two Strings Are Anagrams

Perhaps the easiest way to check whether two strings are anagrams is to put
both strings into a canonical form, and check whether those canonical forms
are equal.

That's what this program does... but exactly how?  There's some severe uncanny
valley misdirection going on in here, I think.
