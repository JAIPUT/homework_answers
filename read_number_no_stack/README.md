# ASM: Read a Multi-Digit Number With Zero Stack Usage

This homework question asks for a program that reads a multidigit number from
the user without using any stack whatsoever.  The only way I know how to do
that is to write it in an assembly language that doesn't require me to use a
stack.

In this case, I chose TMS320C6400 assembly language.  I wasn't actually able
to test the resulting program, but I did pore over it and desk check it
thoroughly.  If someone has a C64x-based device that has a 16550-ish UART
on chip (and I'm pretty sure a few do), I invite you to give it a spin!
