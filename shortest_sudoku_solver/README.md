# C: Shortest Sudoku Sover

This one likely wasn't a homework question, but its answer still has a large
**WTF?** element to it.  The original question allowed for any language, but
I chose C.

Version 2 got down to 373 characters, but it could be shorter by eliminating
more whitespace and shortening the gratuitously long "No solution" message.

For this repo, I added a Version 3 that just squeezed what it could out of
Version 2.
