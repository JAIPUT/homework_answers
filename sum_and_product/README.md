# C++: Compute the Sum and Product of Two Numbers, Passed By Reference

This was a pretty daffy assignment, asking the student to write crap code.  I
am pretty sure the professor wanted something daft such as:

```
void sum_and_product(int& a, int& b) {
  int sum = a + b;
  int prod = a * b;

  a = sum;
  b = prod;
}
```

That's a terrible way to structure a program, IMHO.
