# ASM: Add Even Numbers From 1 to 20 Using a For Loop

For this one, the OP didn't specify a language.  I decided to write my answer
in CP-1600 assembly language.  To meet the requirment of "using a for-loop",
I wrote `FOR` and `NEXT` macros so you end up with something that looks sorta
BASIC-like.
