## Background

Quora receives an endless stream of homework questions, including programming
homework questions. At some point, I decided to start answering these homework
questions with _technically correct_ answers (the best kind of correct!) that
nonetheless aren't useful as homework assignment answers.

![You are technically correct, the best kind of correct](Images/technically_correct.png?raw=true)

Click through the code in this repository to get a taste.  Most of this code
is in C or C++.  You might find the occasional assembly language, however.

## Highlights

* [Print 1 to 100 without a loop or recursion](print_1_to_100_without_a_loop_or_recursion)
  seems to be where it all truly started.  I had some snarky homework answers
  before that, but this is likely where I first crossed the line.
* [Sum of even numbers between 1 and 100 using `goto`](sum_of_evens_1_to_100_with_goto)
  This request truly woke the homework trolling Sith in me, I think.  The
  previous answer was just an incident that hinted as what was to come.

* [The Quickies](quickies) contain a lot of short answers to a wide variety of
  questions.

## Useful and/or Interesting Non-Trolls

* [How does passing an array as an argument to a function differ from call by value?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-passing-an-array-as-an-argument-to-a-function-differ-from-call-by-value/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
* [In C, how do I convert between a character pointer and a character array?](https://www.quora.com/In-C-how-do-I-convert-between-a-character-pointer-and-a-character-array/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
* [What is some non-obfuscated Perl code that does something unexpected?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-some-non-obfuscated-Perl-code-that-does-something-unexpected/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)

## Administrivia

The code here may not be exactly as it appears on Quora.  Quora has decreased
the effective width of code blocks over the years to the point that I often
only have ~30 characters of width to work with.  Here, I allow myself a full 80
columns to work with.

As of January 2023, I've written over 5400 Quora answers.  It's going to take
me awhile to catalog a signficant fraction of my creative programming
homework answers here.  Who knows how far I will get with this before I forget
about it.

Also, I won't be including _every_ such answer.  Some are better than others.
