# C: Compute Factorial Recursively Using Only Main Function

This programming assignment reuqired C, because you can call `main()`
recursively in C, but C++.  (C and C++ are different languages!)

I decided to go all out and make an _arbitrary precision_ implementation.
And for extra WTF, the state machine is driven by the string `"multipl1y"`.
Look carefully!  `:-)`
