# C: Toggle the Case of Characters in Comments

This was a fun litlte exercise:  Read C source code, and in the comments
within it, change all uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa.

Original: [Is it possible to write code in C that changes a .c file comments from uppercase to lower case and vice versa?](https://cstdspace.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-write-code-in-C-that-changes-a-c-file-comments-from-uppercase-to-lower-case-and-vice-versa-2)

This answer is just a wall of WTF, formatting-wise.
