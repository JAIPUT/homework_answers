# C++: Sum of All Even Numbers Between 1 And 100 Using A Goto

Yes, this assignment is as pointless as it sounds.  There's a closed form
expression to find this sum.  You can see the math in [the original answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-sum-of-all-even-numbers-between-1-and-100-using-a-goto-statement-in-C++/answer/Joe-Zbiciak).

In fact, my initial proffered answer was very short.

```
auto sum_of_even_numbers_between_1_and_100_using_a_goto_statement_in_cplusplus() {
   goto pointless_label;
pointless_label:
   return 2450;
}
```

Of course, if you look at the source file in this directory, you'll see I
went much further.  I wrote a short program to generate that.  I don't know
whether I still have it.  If I find it I might add it in here.

Enjoy!
