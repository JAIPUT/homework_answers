# C and C++:  Print a Number and its Square

In this case, I answered approximately the same question twice, the first
time in C and the second time in C++.  Both use the same, erm, _creative_
definition of the word _square._ 

The C version of the question wants the program to display a number and its
square for 10 numbers.  For that one, I also used a creative interpretation
of _number._
