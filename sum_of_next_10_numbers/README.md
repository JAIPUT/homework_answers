# C++: Sum of Next 10 Numbers

This one comes from here:

[How do you write a C++ program that takes a number from the user and prints the sum of the next 10 numbers after the given number? For example, when the user enters 7, the output should be 125.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-write-a-C-program-that-takes-a-number-from-the-user-and-prints-the-sum-of-the-next-10-numbers-after-the-given-number-For-example-when-the-user-enters-7-the-output-should-be-125)

I decided not to interpret "numbers" creatively.  Rather, I realized that the
sum of the numbers 1 through 10 is fixed (55).  Starting at a higher number
changes the result in a well determined way.
