# C: Calculate Average Age of a Class, Using `sizeof()` and a Function

Ah, a classic shibboleth: requesting a mundane task be performed with some
very basic feature of the language.  "Compute X _using a function._"

In this case, I made sure to use both features in a way that precisely nobody
will find useful, except those in search of a laugh from crazy code or those
looking for an example of the value of precise specifications.  

This program's purpose, calculating the average of several inputs, doesn't even
require an array!

_Bonus:_ I slipped a `goto` and a curious comparison with NAN in there as well,
because of course I did.

Please use sizeof() to get the size of array and define a function to return the average value.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-write-a-program-to-calculate-the-average-age-of-a-class-Please-use-sizeof-to-get-the-size-of-array-and-define-a-function-to-return-the-average-value/answer/Joe-Zbiciak)
