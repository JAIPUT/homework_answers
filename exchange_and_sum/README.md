# C: Create, Exchange, and Sum Two Arrays

This was clearly a homework assignment with a collection of unmotivated,
disconnected operations the instructor wanted their students to perform.

This answer resides in a weird uncanny valley, and makes use of the fact that
you can pass `struct` by value in C, even though you can't pass arrays by value.
That includes a `struct` which only contains an array.

That whole bridge from B to C should have been burned down before I was born,
or at least before I entered kindergarten (1980).
